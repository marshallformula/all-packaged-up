# ELM Starter

Based on the [elm-tutorial](http://www.elm-tutorial.org/en/04-starting/cover.html) gitbook. 

`npm run setup` : installs npm & elm dependencies

`npm run build` : builds the application into `/dist`.

`npm run watch` : builds application into `/dist` and watches for changes.

`npm run dev` : runs webpack-dev-server on port **3000**.
